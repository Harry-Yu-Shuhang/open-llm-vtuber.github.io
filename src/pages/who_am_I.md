## Who am I?

Can I condemn this man, to slavery?
Pretend I'm not the man I used to be?
Must my name, until I die, be no more than an alibi?

Must I lie? How can I ever face, my fellow man? How can I ever face myself again?
My soul belongs to GOD I know, I made that BARGAIN long ago.
He GAVE me hope when hope was gone. He gave me STENGTH to journey on........

WHO AM I?

WHO AM I?

I'M JEAN VAL JEAN!!!!!!

And so JAVEAT you see it TRUE
This man bears no more guilt than you.......

WHO AM I?
